# Pluralsight EFCore 6 and DDD
This set of demos goes with my EF Core 6 and Domain-Driven Design course published in May 2023.  
(url for course here)

While DDD is focused on the domain, data persistence is still important to your application workflow. This course will teach you how to use Entity Framework Core 6 and 7 effectively to persist data from their DDD designed software.
