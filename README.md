While DDD is focused on the domain, data persistence is still important to your application workflow. This course will teach you how to use Entity Framework Core 6 and 7 effectively to persist data from their DDD designed software. 

While DDD is focused on the domain, data persistence is still important to your application workflow. This course will teach you how to use Entity Framework Core effectively to persist data from their DDD designed software. Additionally the course provides a review of DDD basics and the process of modeling the domain used in the samples. The final solution is an end-to-end solution incorporating multiple bounded contexts.

The course was updated in 2024 using EF Core 8, C# 12 and enhanced modeling. See https://github.com/julielerman/EFCoreDDDPluralsight the code.
