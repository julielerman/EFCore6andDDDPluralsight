# Pluralsight EFCore 6 and DDD
This set of demos goes with my EF Core 6 and Domain-Driven Design course published in May 2023.  
[bit.ly/EFCoreDDD](https://bit.ly/EFCoreDDD)
(pluralsight.com/courses/ef-core-6-domain-driven-design)

While DDD is focused on the domain, data persistence is still important to your application workflow. This course will teach you how to use Entity Framework Core 6 and 7 effectively to persist data from their DDD designed software.
